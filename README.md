# Google Analytics API Read-only

GAReadOnly is a simple wrapper to get the data out of google analytics using the API.

In order to make the gem work, you'll have few a configuration steps to do in your Google API Console.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'gareadonly'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gareadonly

## Configuration

To install the initializer file execute:

    $ rails g gareadonly

## Usage

    GAReadonly.connect
    pageviews = GAReadonly.get_analytics_data({'start-date' => '2014-01-01', 'end-date' => 'yesterday', 'metrics' => 'ga:pageviews', 'dimensions' => 'ga:date'})
    puts "We had #{pageviews.totalsForAllResults['ga:pageviews']} since the 2014-01-01'
    
To connect to the Google API, you'll  need to run `GAReadonly.connect`. In therory you only need to run it ounce. The connection is persistant.

Currently the only query available is `get_analytics_data`. It takes an hash as argument. The following hash will retrieve all the page views since the begining of the year 2014 `GAReadonly.get_analytics_data({'start-date' => '2014-01-01', 'end-date' => 'yesterday', 'metrics' => 'ga:pageviews', 'dimensions' => 'ga:date'})`
